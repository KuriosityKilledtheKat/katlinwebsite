  	<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspKat Lin hates defining herself or being defined. <br> 
  	But since this is a bio page, for our purposes, we'll say 
  	<br> that she is a nonfiction writer and photographer... </p>

  	<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspShe defected from the world of biomedical <br>engineering  after graduating with a Bachelor's and <br>currently lives semi-nomadically as she galavants around <br>the world while sometimes being paid to do so. </p> 

  	<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She aspires to be a more well-rounded experimental storyteller and hopefully one day, will somehow manage combine her writing, photography, digital media editing, engineering background, and choreographic experience. </p>

  	<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This background image is a dslr selfie taken on a <br>3.5-month solo trip across Europe as she passed through Switzerland. </p>
