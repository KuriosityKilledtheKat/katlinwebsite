<h1>kat lin</h1>
<h2>(exists)</h2>


<p> Kat Lin hates defining herself or being defined. But for our purposes, she is a nonfiction writer and photographer... and aspriing experimental storyteller who hopes to one day somehow combine her writing, photography, digital media editing, engineering background, and choreographic experience. </p>
<p>She defected from the world of biomedical engineering after graduating with a Bachelor's and currently lives semi-nomadically as she galavants around the world while sometimes being paid to do so.</p>
