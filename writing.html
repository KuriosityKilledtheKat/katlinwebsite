<h1>kat lin</h1>
<h2>(writes sometimes)</h2>
<br>


<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kat writes about things that challenge her perspective of the world and makes her think. Her heart belongs to narrative and literary journalism--the kind that people read for 5 seconds before realizing it's way longer than they're willing to commit to and say "I didn't realize it was so long. I'll just read this later" to be polite but will probably not ever finish reading. </p>

<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the past, she has written about the rise of non-emergency 911 calls, the Facebook phenomenon Subtle Asian Traits, elephant legal personhood, and more. She has words in the New Yorker online, The Juggernaut, and Climbing Magazine. </p>
